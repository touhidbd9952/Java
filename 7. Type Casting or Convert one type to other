In Java, there are two types of casting:

    Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
    byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

    Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
    double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte 
    
    

// integer to double
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt;  // Automatic casting: int to double

//double to integer
double myDouble = 9.78d;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int
